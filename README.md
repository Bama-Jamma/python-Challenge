## Helping a company understand it's finances (PyBank)
in this Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## How to Use
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Download the election_data.csv file and save it in the same directory as the Python script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python script and CSV   file are located.
3. Run the script by typing python vote_count.py and pressing Enter.
4. The script should print out the election results to the terminal and also send them to a text file called election_results.txt in the anlysis folder.


## Dependencies
This script requires you to have a folder named "PyBank", in that folder you need to have the main.py file, you need two folders within the "PyBank" folder. One labeled "resources" and another named anlysis. In the resources folder you need to have the budget_data.csv file.

Make your your terminal is in the PyBank folder when running the script.

# Vote Counting Process Modernization (PyPoll)
##Vote Counting Process Modernization
This Python script is designed to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. It takes in poll data from a CSV file and calculates various statistics, including the total number of votes cast, the list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## How to Use
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Download the election_data.csv file and save it in the same directory as the Python script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python script and CSV   file are located.
3. Run the script by typing python vote_count.py and pressing Enter.
4. The script should print out the election results to the terminal and also send them to a text file called election_results.txt in the anlysis folder.


## Dependencies
This script requires you to have a folder named "PyPoll", in that folder you need to have the main.py file, you need two folders within the "PyPoll" folder. One labeled "resources" and another named anlysis. In the resources folder you need to have the election_data.csv file.

Make your your terminal is in the PyPoll folder when running the script.
